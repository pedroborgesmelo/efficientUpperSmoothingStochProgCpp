# efficientUpperSmoothingStochProgCpp
Efficient implementation of the Upper Smoothing technique applied to the convex two-stage stochastic programming problem to compete with high performance Bundle codes such as Frangioni's. The Upper Smoothing strategy has the advantage of being able to provide decomposition strategies for non-convex two-stage stochastic programming problems, among many other uses. This implementation shows that even for the convex case, a more general strategy like the Upper Smoothing, can be competitive.
